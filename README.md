#### Intro to D3 with a simple Scatterplot!

In this exercise, we'll build an animated scatterplot showing win totals vs team payrolls for every team in Major League Baseball between 2012 and 2015. The data comes from baseball-reference.com:

* [2012 Major League Baseball Attendance & Miscellaneous](http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2012-misc.shtml)
* [2013 Major League Baseball Attendance & Miscellaneous](http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2013-misc.shtml)
* [2012 Major League Baseball Attendance & Miscellaneous](http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2014-misc.shtml)
* [2012 Major League Baseball Attendance & Miscellaneous](http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2015-misc.shtml)

For the sake of cramming this all into a 1-hour tutorial, we've combined the data into a single CSV file, which can be found in the `js/mlb.csv` directory.
